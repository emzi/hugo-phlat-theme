### Posts
- Each post must be located in `content/post`
- A post should be started with the below snippet (called 'frontmatter') at the beginnig:

        +++
        author = "Author"
        categories = [ "Category" ]
        date = "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+03:30"
        description = "Description"
        draft = true/false
        tags = [ "tag1", "tag2" ]
        title = "Title"
        +++

    `YYYY-MM-DD` should be in Gregorian date. `hh:mm:ss` refers to time and don't touch `03:30` which is [Iran UTC time offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B03:30). You may also see `04:30` that is because of detected summer clock on author's OS.
    When you are still working on your post, set the `draft` as `true`. Once completed, ensure itâ€™s no longer a draft: `hugo undraft content/post/<file-name>.md` or simply replace 'true' with 'false'.

- Put images in `static/img` directory.
